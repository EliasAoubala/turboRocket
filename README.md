# TurboRocket

*A python library for the design and development of turbomachinery in rocket applications.*

## Background

TurboRocket is a python library enabling the design of turbomachinery components for liquid rocket propulsion systems.

The main goal of this project is to create a set of tools that can be used by designers to create simplified models to assess turbomachinery performance.    

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the TurboRocket library.

Navigate to your local clone of this repository, and install it locally by using the following command.
